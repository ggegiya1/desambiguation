  <h1>Attribute-Relation File Format (ARFF)</h1>

  <p>November 1st, 2008</p>

  This documentation is superceded by the Wiki article <a href="http://weka.wikispaces.com/ARFF" target="_blank">ARFF</a>.

  <p>
   An ARFF (Attribute-Relation File Format) file is an ASCII text file
   that describes a list of instances sharing a set of attributes.
   ARFF files were developed by the Machine Learning Project at the
   Department of Computer Science of The University of Waikato for use
   with the <a href="http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/~ml/">Weka machine
   learning software</a>.  This document descibes the version of ARFF
   used with Weka versions 3.2 to 3.3; this is an extension of the ARFF
   format as described in the data mining book written by Ian H. Witten
   and Eibe Frank (the new additions are string attributes,
   date attributes, and sparse instances).
  </p>

  <p>
   This explanation was cobbled together by Gordon Paynter (gordon.paynter at
   ucr.edu) from the Weka 2.1 ARFF description, email from Len Trigg (lenbok at
   myrealbox.com) and Eibe Frank (eibe at cs.waikato.ac.nz), and some datasets.
   It has been edited by Richard Kirkby (rkirkby at cs.waikato.ac.nz).  Contact
   Len if you're interested in seeing the ARFF 3 proposal.
  </p>

  <h2>Overview</h2>

  <p>
   ARFF files have two distinct sections.  The first section is the
   <b>Header</b> information, which is followed the <b>Data</b>
   information.
  </p>

  <p>
   The <b>Header</b> of the ARFF file contains the name of the
   relation, a list of the attributes (the columns in the data), and
   their types. An example header on the standard IRIS dataset looks
   like this:
  </p>

  <pre>   % 1. Title: Iris Plants Database
   % 
   % 2. Sources:
   %      (a) Creator: R.A. Fisher
   %      (b) Donor: Michael Marshall (MARSHALL%PLU@io.arc.nasa.gov)
   %      (c) Date: July, 1988
   % 
   @RELATION iris

   @ATTRIBUTE sepallength  NUMERIC
   @ATTRIBUTE sepalwidth   NUMERIC
   @ATTRIBUTE petallength  NUMERIC
   @ATTRIBUTE petalwidth   NUMERIC
   @ATTRIBUTE class        {Iris-setosa,Iris-versicolor,Iris-virginica}
  </pre>

  <p>
   The <b>Data</b> of the ARFF file looks like the following:
  </p>

  <pre>   @DATA
   5.1,3.5,1.4,0.2,Iris-setosa
   4.9,3.0,1.4,0.2,Iris-setosa
   4.7,3.2,1.3,0.2,Iris-setosa
   4.6,3.1,1.5,0.2,Iris-setosa
   5.0,3.6,1.4,0.2,Iris-setosa
   5.4,3.9,1.7,0.4,Iris-setosa
   4.6,3.4,1.4,0.3,Iris-setosa
   5.0,3.4,1.5,0.2,Iris-setosa
   4.4,2.9,1.4,0.2,Iris-setosa
   4.9,3.1,1.5,0.1,Iris-setosa
  </pre>

  <p>
   Lines that begin with a % are comments.  The <b>@RELATION</b>,
   <b>@ATTRIBUTE</b> and <b>@DATA</b> declarations are case
   insensitive.
  </p>

  <h2>Examples</h2>

  <p>
   Several well-known machine learning datasets are distributed with
   Weka in the $WEKAHOME/data directory as ARFF files.
  </p>

  <h2>The ARFF Header Section</h2>

  <p>
   The ARFF Header section of the file contains the relation
   declaration and attribute declarations.
  </p>

  <h3>The @relation Declaration</h3>

  <p>
   The relation name is defined as the first line in the ARFF file. The
   format is: 

   </p><pre>    @relation &lt;relation-name&gt;
   </pre>

   where &lt;relation-name&gt; is a string. The string must be quoted if
   the name includes spaces.
  <p></p>

  <h3>The @attribute Declarations</h3>

  <p>
   Attribute declarations take the form of an orderd sequence of
   <b>@attribute</b> statements.  Each attribute in the data set has
   its own <b>@attribute</b> statement which uniquely defines the name
   of that attribute and it's data type.  The order the attributes are
   declared indicates the column position in the data section of the
   file.  For example, if an attribute is the third one declared then
   Weka expects that all that attributes values will be found in the
   third comma delimited column.
  </p>

  <p>
   The format for the <b>@attribute</b> statement is:

   </p><pre>    @attribute &lt;attribute-name&gt; &lt;datatype&gt;
   </pre>

   where the <i>&lt;attribute-name&gt;</i> must start with an
   alphabetic character.  If spaces are to be included in the name
   then the entire name must be quoted.
  <p></p>

  <p>
   The <i>&lt;datatype&gt;</i> can be any of the four types currently
   (version 3.2.1) supported by Weka:
   </p><ul>
    <li>numeric</li>
    <li>&lt;nominal-specification&gt;</li>
    <li>string</li>
    <li>date [&lt;date-format&gt;]</li>
   </ul>
   where &lt;nominal-specification&gt; and &lt;date-format&gt; are
   defined below.  The keywords <b>numeric</b>,
   <b>string</b> and <b>date</b> are case insensitive.
  <p></p>

  <h4>Numeric attributes</h4>

  <p>
   Numeric attributes can be real or integer numbers.
  </p>

  <h4>Nominal attributes</h4>

  <p>
   Nominal values are defined by providing an
   &lt;nominal-specification&gt; listing the possible values:
   {&lt;nominal-name1&gt;, &lt;nominal-name2&gt;, &lt;nominal-name3&gt;, ...}
  </p>

  <p>
   For example, the class value of the Iris dataset can be defined as
   follows:
   </p><pre>    @ATTRIBUTE class        {Iris-setosa,Iris-versicolor,Iris-virginica}
   </pre>
  <p></p>

  <p>
   Values that contain spaces must be quoted.
  </p>

  <h4>String attributes</h4>

  <p>
   String attributes allow us to create attributes containing
   arbitrary textual values.  This is very useful in text-mining
   applications, as we can create datasets with string attributes,
   then write Weka Filters to manipulate strings (like
   StringToWordVectorFilter).  String attributes are declared as
   follows:

   </p><pre>    @ATTRIBUTE LCC    string
   </pre>
  <p></p>

  <h4>Date attributes</h4>

  <p>
   Date attribute declarations take the form:

   </p><pre>    @attribute &lt;name&gt; date [&lt;date-format&gt;]
   </pre>

   where &lt;name&gt; is the name for the attribute and
   &lt;date-format&gt; is an optional string specifying how date
   values should be parsed and printed (this is the same format used
   by SimpleDateFormat). The default format string accepts the
   ISO-8601 combined date and time format: "yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss".
  <p></p>

  <p>
   Dates must be specified in the data section as the corresponding
   string representations of the date/time (see example below). 
  </p>

  <h2>ARFF Data Section</h2>

  <p>
   The ARFF Data section of the file contains the data declaration
   line and the actual instance lines.
  </p>

  <h3>The @data Declaration</h3>

  <p>
   The <b>@data</b> declaration is a single line denoting the start of
   the data segment in the file.  The format is:
   </p><pre>    @data
   </pre>
  <p></p>

  <h3>The instance data</h3>

  <p>
   Each instance is represented on a single line, with carriage returns
   denoting the end of the instance.
  </p>

  <p>
   Attribute values for each instance are delimited by commas.  They
   must appear in the order that they were declared in the header
   section (i.e. the data corresponding to the nth <b>@attribute</b>
   declaration is always the nth field of the attribute).
  </p>

  <p>
   Missing values are represented by a single question mark, as in:

   </p><pre>    @data
    4.4,?,1.5,?,Iris-setosa
   </pre>
  <p></p>

  <p>
   Values of string and nominal attributes are case sensitive, and any
   that contain space must be quoted, as follows:
   </p><pre>    @relation LCCvsLCSH

    @attribute LCC string
    @attribute LCSH string

    @data
    AG5,   'Encyclopedias and dictionaries.;Twentieth century.'
    AS262, 'Science -- Soviet Union -- History.'
    AE5,   'Encyclopedias and dictionaries.'
    AS281, 'Astronomy, Assyro-Babylonian.;Moon -- Phases.'
    AS281, 'Astronomy, Assyro-Babylonian.;Moon -- Tables.'
   </pre>
  <p></p>

  <p>
   Dates must be specified in the data section using the string
   representation specified in the attribute declaration.  For
   example:
   </p><pre>    @RELATION Timestamps

    @ATTRIBUTE timestamp DATE "yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss" 

    @DATA 
    "2001-04-03 12:12:12"
    "2001-05-03 12:59:55"
   </pre>
  <p></p>   

  <h2>Sparse ARFF files</h2>

  <p>
   Sparse ARFF files are very similar to ARFF files, but data with
   value 0 are not be explicitly represented.
  </p>

  <p>
   Sparse ARFF files have the same header (i.e <b>@relation</b> and
   <b>@attribute</b> tags) but the data section is different.  Instead of
   representing each value in order, like this:
   </p><pre>    @data
    0, X, 0, Y, "class A"
    0, 0, W, 0, "class B"
   </pre>
   the non-zero attributes are explicitly identified by attribute
   number and their value stated, like this:
   <pre>    @data
    {1 X, 3 Y, 4 "class A"}
    {2 W, 4 "class B"}
   </pre>
  <p></p>

  <p>
   Each instance is surrounded by curly braces, and the format for
   each entry is: &lt;index&gt; &lt;space&gt; &lt;value&gt; where index is the
   attribute index (starting from 0).
  </p>

  <p>
   Note that the omitted values in a sparse instance are <b>0</b>,
   they are not "missing" values!  If a value is unknown,
   you must explicitly represent it with a question mark (?).
  </p>

  <p>
   <b>Warning</b>: There is a known problem saving SparseInstance
   objects from datasets that have string attributes.  In Weka, string
   and nominal data values are stored as numbers; these numbers act as
   indexes into an array of possible attribute values (this is very
   efficient).  However, the first string value is assigned index 0:
   this means that, internally, this value is stored as a 0.  When a
   SparseInstance is written, string instances with internal value 0
   are not output, so their string value is lost (and when the arff
   file is read again, the default value 0 is the index of a different
   string value, so the attribute value appears to change).  To get
   around this problem, add a dummy string value at index 0 that is
   never used whenever you declare string attributes that are likely
   to be used in SparseInstance objects and saved as Sparse ARFF
   files.
